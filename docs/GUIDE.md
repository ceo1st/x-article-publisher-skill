# X Article Publisher Framework

This document explains the runtime framework behind `x-article-publisher`. It is written for users who want to understand, debug, or adapt the workflow.

## 1. Source Framework

The skill has two source modes.

| Source | Trigger | First step | Media strategy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feishu/Lark URL | URL contains `feishu.cn`, `larksuite.com`, `feishu.sg`, or `feishu.com` | Download to local Markdown with `prepare_article_source.py` | Recover videos from Feishu dump JSON, then parse local Markdown |
| Local Markdown | Local `.md` or `.markdown` path | Use the file directly | Parse local images/videos from Markdown |

### Feishu URL Mode

1. Call `feishu2md dl --dump -o <workdir> <url>`.
2. If the URL contains `/wiki/`, add `--wiki`.
3. Find the generated Markdown and dump JSON.
4. Extract video file blocks from dump JSON.
5. Download video files from Feishu OpenAPI into `static/`.
6. Normalize Feishu callout labels such as `Tip` or `[!TIP]` while keeping multiline quoted content.
7. Insert `<video src="static/...">` blocks near source text anchors.
8. Return the local Markdown path.

### Local Markdown Mode

1. Validate the file exists and has `.md` or `.markdown` suffix.
2. Return the original file path.
3. Let `parse_markdown.py` resolve local image/video paths relative to the Markdown directory.

Supported local video syntax:

```markdown
<video src="./static/demo.mp4"></video>
<video><source src="./static/demo.mp4"></video>
[video](./static/demo.mp4)
```

Remote `http(s)` media URLs are detected but not treated as reliable uploadable files.

## 2. Environment Framework

There are two installation paths.

### Full Codex Setup

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LearnPrompt/x-article-publisher-skill/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script:

1. Installs the skill to `$CODEX_HOME/skills/x-article-publisher`.
2. Installs Python packages from `skills/x-article-publisher/requirements.txt`.
3. Primes `@playwright/mcp` when `npx` is available.
4. Tries `brew install feishu2md` when Homebrew is available.
5. Prints the `doctor.sh` command for verification.

### skills.sh Compatible Setup

```bash
npx skills add LearnPrompt/x-article-publisher-skill --skill x-article-publisher --global --copy --yes --full-depth
```

This installs skill files only. It does not install runtime dependencies, so users still need Python packages, Playwright MCP, and `feishu2md` for Feishu mode.

### feishu2md Installation

Feishu URL mode requires `feishu2md`.

Homebrew:

```bash
brew install feishu2md
```

Manual:
1. Download a binary from [Wsine/feishu2md releases](https://github.com/Wsine/feishu2md/releases).
2. Put `feishu2md` on `PATH`.
3. Verify with `feishu2md -h`.

- [Homebrew formula: feishu2md](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/feishu2md)

### Feishu/Lark App Setup

Create a custom app in:
- Feishu: [open.feishu.cn/app](https://open.feishu.cn/app)
- Lark: [open.larksuite.com/app](https://open.larksuite.com/app)

Copy its App ID and App Secret, then run:

```bash
feishu2md config --appId <your_app_id> --appSecret <your_app_secret>
```

Minimum permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docx:document:readonly` | Read document metadata and blocks |
| `docs:document.media:download` | Download images/files/videos from docs |
| `drive:file:readonly` | Read cloud drive files/folders referenced by docs |
| `wiki:wiki:readonly` | Resolve wiki links |

API references:
- [Get document basic info](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/docs/docx-v1/document/get)
- [Get document blocks](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/docs/docx-v1/document/list)
- [Download media](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/drive-v1/media/download)
- [Get wiki node info](https://open.feishu.cn/document/server-docs/docs/wiki-v2/space-node/get_node)

### Doctor Checks

```bash
bash ~/.codex/skills/x-article-publisher/scripts/doctor.sh
bash ~/.codex/skills/x-article-publisher/scripts/doctor.sh local
bash ~/.codex/skills/x-article-publisher/scripts/doctor.sh feishu
```

The doctor script checks Python, clipboard dependencies, Playwright CLI availability, `feishu2md`, Feishu app credentials, and the X persistent profile path.

---

## 3. Browser Framework

X is opened through `open_x_articles_browser.sh`.

Resolution order:

1. Use Codex Playwright wrapper if available: `$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh`.
2. Use `playwright-cli` from `PATH`.
3. Use `npx --yes --package @playwright/mcp playwright-cli`.

Default profile:

```text
~/.codex/browser-profiles/x-articles
```

Override with:

```bash
export X_ARTICLES_PROFILE=/custom/profile/path
```

This profile is separate from the user's daily Chrome profile. It avoids repeated X logins while not overwriting the user's existing browser session.

---

## 4. Markdown Parsing Framework

`parse_markdown.py` extracts:

- title
- cover image, defined as the first image
- body HTML for rich-text paste
- `content_media`, a unified ordered list of images and videos
- `content_images` and `content_videos` for compatibility
- dividers from `---`
- `block_index` and `after_text` for insertion positioning
- missing media counts

Media insertion uses descending `block_index` so earlier insertions do not shift later targets.

---

## 5. X Draft Assembly Framework

The publishing workflow should follow this order:

1. Resolve source with `prepare_article_source.py`.
2. Parse Markdown with `parse_markdown.py`.
3. Open X Articles with persistent profile.
4. Upload cover image.
5. Fill title.
6. Paste HTML body via clipboard.
7. Insert content images by descending `block_index`.
8. Insert content videos by descending `block_index`.
9. Insert dividers by descending `block_index`.
10. Open preview and verify media count plus anchor order.
11. Save draft only.

Do not auto-publish.

---

## 6. Video Ordering Framework

Feishu often represents embedded videos as file blocks, while `feishu2md` focuses on image tokens. The extra recovery step is therefore required.

The skill keeps order by:

1. Reading root block order from Feishu dump JSON.
2. Finding the nearest text-like block around each video.
3. Using that text as an anchor.
4. Matching the anchor against Markdown with exact matching first, then whitespace-insensitive matching.
5. Inserting video Markdown after the matched paragraph.
6. Reporting anchor misses instead of appending videos to the article tail.

This prevents the failure mode where all videos appear at the end of the X article.

---

## 7. X Video Upload Framework

X video processing creates an `Uploading media...` overlay that can intercept further clicks. The safe rule is:

1. Transcode very large or high-bitrate videos before upload when possible.
2. Upload one video file.
3. Wait until the upload overlay disappears.
4. Confirm no failure toast is visible.
5. Continue with the next video.

Large videos can take minutes. Keep waiting if the media block is visible and no failure is shown.

Recommended video preflight for fragile uploads:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -i input.mov \
  -vf "scale='min(1280,iw)':-2" \
  -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p \
  -c:a aac -b:a 64k -movflags +faststart \
  output.x1280.mp4
```

This has been more stable than uploading 40-90MB, high-bitrate screen recordings directly.

When the X editor becomes unstable during long video runs, restart the dedicated profile and resume from the existing draft URL. Do not paste the article body again; locate the next missing media anchor and continue.

---

## 8. Final Preview Audit Framework

Do not treat a draft as ready just because the media count looks right in the editor. A correct count can still hide one media item inserted under the wrong anchor.

The final audit should check:

1. Cover image exists.
2. Body image count matches `content_images`.
3. Body video count matches `content_videos`.
4. Each source media anchor maps to the next visible media item of the expected type.
5. For videos, preview DOM contains `video[aria-label="Embedded video"]` or `Play Video` buttons.

If a video appears under the wrong later anchor:

1. Delete only that misplaced media block.
2. Reinsert the missing image/video at its original anchor.
3. Reinsert the misplaced video at its own anchor.
4. Re-run the preview audit.

---

## 9. Field Limits

### Body media count

In field tests, X Articles may silently stop accepting body media after roughly `25` body media items. This number is based on repeated real uploads, not official X documentation.

Recommended handling:

1. Split the article when body media exceeds `25` items.
2. If it must remain one article, merge consecutive screenshots into a long image or keep only the most important videos.
3. Do not retry indefinitely after the 26th media item; this is usually not a network issue.

### PNG compatibility

Some PNG files are accepted by the file input but do not create a media block in the X editor. Converting that image to JPG and retrying has worked as a practical fallback.

### Feishu callout labels

Feishu highlighted blocks may export as blockquotes prefixed with `Tip`, `Note`, or `[!TIP]`. These labels are not useful in X Articles and can break the reading flow. The source preparation and Markdown parser remove those labels while preserving the blockquote body and line breaks.

### Persistent profile ownership

If the persistent profile is already held by an existing Chrome process, Playwright may report that the page opened in an existing browser session. Close only the Chrome process using `~/.codex/browser-profiles/x-articles`; do not close the user's daily Chrome profile.

## 10. Troubleshooting

For a focused troubleshooting checklist, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

### Feishu app credentials missing

Feishu app credentials mean the App ID and App Secret of a Feishu/Lark custom app. They are used by `feishu2md` and by this skill's video recovery step to call Feishu APIs. They are not user login credentials.

Run:

```bash
feishu2md config --appId <your_app_id> --appSecret <your_app_secret>
```

Or set:

```bash
export FEISHU_APP_ID=<your_app_id>
export FEISHU_APP_SECRET=<your_app_secret>
```

Then test a Feishu document export directly:

```bash
feishu2md dl --dump -o /tmp/feishu2md-test "https://your-domain.feishu.cn/docx/..."
```

### X login expired

Reopen with:

```bash
bash ~/.codex/skills/x-article-publisher/scripts/open_x_articles_browser.sh
```

Complete the login manually once, then reuse the same profile.

### Media file not found

Check parse output:

```bash
python ~/.codex/skills/x-article-publisher/scripts/parse_markdown.py /path/to/article.md
```

Look at `missing_media`, `missing_images`, and `missing_videos`.

### Remote media URL

Remote URLs are not converted into uploadable local files. Download them first or keep media next to the Markdown file.
